                   Masks
                 </h1>
                 <p>
                   Masks are deeply connected to Sri Lankan folk-lore and take on a functional role where they are used in healing rites and rituals. Known popularly as devil dances, some are dance-drama performances that tell an elaborate story and is enacted by experienced dancers and actors wearing these masks.

                  One of the most popular and ancient acts is the 18 Sanni that are thought to represent diseases or ailments caused by yakkas (devils). Eighteen masks carved to represent the torment felt through these diseases are worn by an exorcist and a tovil, a devil dance, is performed. Other popular mask dances or dramas are Kolam and Raksha, one a comedic performance and the other masks mainly used in festivals and processions. 

                  Ambalangoda is known to be the heart of mask carving with many shops dotting the roadside as you drive along this coastal town. If you happen to pop into one of the stores, you will be able to see how these masks are carved and painted with brilliant colours and take one along as well.

                 </h1>
                 <p>
                   Long ago handloom was reserved exclusively for the royalty and the renowned in the country and special villages were designated to practice the craft. However, now Handloom is generally found around the island as a self-employed or entrepreneurial activity where this skill which has been passed down from generation to generation has been revived and practised.

Among handloom products in Sri Lanka are, curtains, cushion covers and other household decorative items, saris and garments as well as everyday items such as books and bags.

Handwoven fabrics, with their vibrant colours and simple or elaborate patterns, have become a favourite among shoppers.

                   Dumbara weaves, a unique work of art once found only as decorative pieces and mats are now seen integrated into the modern world; it can now be seen infused with designs of wall hangings and decorative items, bags and purses, rugs and carpets along with household utilities such as table mats and sheets.

The art is said to have originated in the village of Thalagune Uda Dumbara, where still a handful of Dumbara weavers—descendants of the ones who practised the craft during the Kandyan era still remains carrying on the legacy. The skill is well guarded within the few families that hold the secret to this amazing art.

The designs found on the Dumbara weaver’s products are specific to the Sri Lankan culture and reflect the traditions within its intricate weave-work.
